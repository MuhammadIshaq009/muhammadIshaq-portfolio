        description: "I was part of the team building Threads (https://threads.txend.com), a low‑code application to design and run corporate workflows such as procurement and hiring. I focused mainly on front‑end development with React.js and TypeScript, crafting user‑friendly UIs. Key work included a configurable Aggregate input with pre‑defined Excel‑like formulas plus a custom code editor to write logic using form inputs; implementing User Roles, Skills and Users; integrating APIs to populate TanStack Table views for workflows, forms, submission dates, initiated threads, users, and roles; improving UX with Tailwind CSS and Material UI; and managing business logic with Redux Toolkit and React Hooks to minimize memory usage.",

        description: "In this project, I'm using data from Facebook live sellers in Thailand (7050 rows, 16 attributes) including post type (video, photo, link, status) and engagement-related fields. The goal is to apply K‑Means clustering and Hierarchical clustering to analyze behavior and compare which algorithm yields better separations. I also apply PCA to study variance, reduce dimensionality, and identify which attributes are most important. Insights help sales teams optimize content strategy (e.g., which post types get more responses) for the Thai market on Facebook.",

        description: "Skin disease may be bacterial or fungal, and early detection is key. With two teammates, I built an Android app that detects skin diseases by capturing a photo of the affected area. The aim is to enable earlier, lower-cost screening using a mobile phone camera and reduce unnecessary clinic visits at the first stage. After detection, users can contact a doctor, choose from an available list, and book a consultation slot—making it a smart clinic experience for skin conditions.",
